The dataset typically includes key details such as Collision ID, Date, Time, Borough, Street Name, Latitude, Longitude, Contributing Factor, Vehicle Type, Persons Injured, Persons Killed, and breakdowns by pedestrians, cyclists, and motorists affected by the accidents. The goal of the analysis is to provide a data-driven understanding of traffic accident patterns, risks, and contributing factors.
